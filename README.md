# burger
Week 14 (handlebars) Assignment

### Overview
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.  I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.

### How To Use
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
